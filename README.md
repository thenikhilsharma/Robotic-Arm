# Robotic-Arm

**About Me**
<br></br>
Hi myself Nikhil Sharma, a 2nd year undergrad from Mechanical Branch at VNIT Nagpur.

**About this Project**
<br></br>
This project is based on servo control via Arduino UNO microcontroller. It mimics the functionality of a human arm. It has an elbow joint, a shoulder joint, a wrist with 2 degree of rotation and a hand like gripper which can be controlled wirelessly.

**What tech did I use**
1. Arduino UNO
2. Bluetooth Module BM05
3. Servo Motor SG90
4. Jumper Wire

**Purpose of this project**
<br></br>
To integrate this in various rovers or non man missions to fulfill the capability of human presence.

**Future upgrades**
1. Add joystick control support
2. integration on wirelessly controlled rovers
